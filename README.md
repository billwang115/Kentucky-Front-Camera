Using an arduino, this program can help as an aid for the visually impaired. This program utilizes a motion sensor, an ultrasonic sensor and a piezo speaker for the Arduino Uno to provide obstacle recognition for the blind. If the arduino detects any motion, the program will cause the piezo speaker to beep at different pitches depending on the distance of the obstacle.
